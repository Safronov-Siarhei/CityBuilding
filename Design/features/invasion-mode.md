# Invasion mode («Нашествие»)

> **Status (2026-10-21):** in progress. Done: the Invasion map `Inv1`, «В бой» starts a run, the King
> hero (model, jointed animation, XP/levels/respawn), the run's economy (6 houses × 3 people, 9
> buildings, wood/stone prices, no food/tax/happiness). Next (plan in the log): King portrait + tap
> select; orc WAVES on three lanes; forest monsters + boss; round orc camps; score and leaderboards.
> **The authoritative record is `Design/Invasion.md`** (Russian): the user's answers in four rounds,
> how it works now, the plan and a changelog. Read it before touching the mode and append to its log.
> **Read with:** [army-and-soldiers](army-and-soldiers.md), [maps-and-terrain](maps-and-terrain.md),

## In one paragraph
Endless defence of a base island against ever-stronger orc waves, played as the King-hero. Dota-like
map: the island behind a river ring, three earth causeways (not plank bridges) and lanes out to three
round orc camps, jungles with monster camps between them, a boss lair. Simplified economy: gold
(kills, waves), wood, stone, people. Score grows faster than the wave number (10→100, 20→400, 30→900);
daily/weekly/monthly ladders; an interrupted run ends and costs points. Lose = the castle falls.
No pause, no speed-up, no autosave, no ore veins, no sandbox raids/illness/fires in a run.

## Code
`Scripts/Invasion/InvasionMode.cs` (turns sandbox systems off, places castle, towers at the
causeways, the King), `InvasionRules.cs` (the 9-building menu, wood/stone prices, upgrades also take
gold, repairs, nothing waits on the Laboratory or decays), `InvasionPeople.cs` (houses respawn a person
every 15 s while people < places; a burnt house loses its places for good);
`Combat/KingHero.cs` (XP = health of any enemy falling within `king_xp_radius`, levels, respawn at the
castle), `Combat/FigureAnimator.cs` (stand/run/strike without an Animator), `SoldierType.King` (own
group, outside the army cap); entry `MainMenuController.StartInvasion` →
`GameSessionIntent.NewGameIsInvasion`. Map spots by kind: `MeshMapDefinition.SpotsOf(kind)`
(`camp`, `monsters`, `boss`, `shrine`, `bridge`).

## Data
economy `king_*`, `inv_*`; localization `#unit_king`. Blender: `Tools/blender/invasion1.py`,
`render_invasion1.py`, `heroking.py` (jointed; export routes `Hero*` to `Models/Heroes`).

## Tests
PlayMode `InvasionTests`.
