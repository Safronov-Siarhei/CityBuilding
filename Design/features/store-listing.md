# Store listing (Google Play)

**Status (2026-11-10):** two icon candidates drawn and polished at the user's request; the user
liked both and will give corrections next. Not yet uploaded anywhere; no store screenshots yet.

## Icon
- Concepts proposed: island diorama, orc over the wall, builder king, banner crest, galleon. The user
  picked **2 (orc)** and **3 (king)**; both polished, to be A/B tested later with Play Console store
  listing experiments.
- `Tools/store/make_icons.py` (PIL, no inputs) draws both and writes `Design/store/`:
  `Icon_Orc_512.png`, `Icon_King_512.png` (the store needs 512x512 PNG, no alpha) and
  `Icons_Sheet.png` (Google Play's rounded mask, at 512/192/96/48 px: 48 is the size in search).
- Style: flat cartoon, thick dark outline, cel shading via `clipped()` (shade polygons masked to a
  shape), `soft()` glows, vignette. Orc: sunset, smoke, embers, mossy wall, iron axe. King: town,
  scaffolding, red cloak with ermine, crown, hammer, sparkles.
- Rules: no text and no badges (Google forbids "#1", "free"...); keep the subject in the middle ~80%
  (the mask rounds the corners); judge it at 48 px.

## Open
- The user's corrections to both icons.
- The king is not a character in the game yet (if he wins, he may need to appear in the menu/tutorial).
- Feature graphic 1024x500 and screenshots.
